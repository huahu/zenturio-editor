zenturio-editor
===============

Zenturio Editor - simple web-oriented text editor for developers that are tired of huge IDEs and expensive software.
If you just need to edit some files in your project (local or remote) then this editor is really good option.
It could be started on any machine where NodeJS is installed.

This editor based on Ace (http://ace.c9.io/). Works better with console or ssh-access to your project.

## Installation

    [sudo] npm install -g zenturio-editor

## Usage

In directory of your project run:

    $ zenturio-editor

Then open `http://IP-or-hostname:3000/` in browser.

## TODO

1. Quick Search
2. More in Tree View
3. More Shortcuts
4. Improved settings (port, ip filters)
5. Improved security (http auth, cross-project saving)
6. ???
